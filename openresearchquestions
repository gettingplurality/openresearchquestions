These open research questions were originally sourced by GETTING-Plurality research network members, prioritized using plural voting, and curated by our team. We hope to continue to build out this list with additional open research questions raised by the impacts of artificial intelligence, and will add relevant research and people working on these critical questions to this living document. We encourage the community to contribute to this open repository and to connect with our team if you are working on tackling any of this research.

# The Digital Public Sphere and Deliberative Democracy
* What new technologies, governance mechanisms, and practices will be necessary to develop a digital public commons safe from corporate capture and overwhelming privatization?
* How might LLMs distort the 'digital public sphere' by enabling the spread of mis/disinformation?
* Can some of these tools be used to strengthen deliberative democracy?
* How should we build mechanisms for communities to express and experience more agency in the way that technologies are deployed on them to shape their individual and population health?
* Do LLMs distort, mimic, and generate toxic language? How might this language affect deliberative processes?
* How can and should platforms seek to develop algorithmic ranking systems which bridge ideological divides, and how should these 'bridging-based ranking' systems be designed and deployed? What are the technological and institutional pre-conditions for legitimate decision-making on the ends and constituents of a bridging-based ranking system?
* What kinds of data protections are now necessary to preserve privacy, human dignity, and security without sacrificing either fairness or the positive network effects of public community membership?
* Whose social consensus matters most in a given issue area under conditions of oligarchic financial power?

# Regulatory Approaches
* How might LLMs encourage and enable fraud, crime, and deceptive use by bad actors?
* What regulatory tools are available? Is a slowdown viable?
* To guide regulatory approaches, what analogies can we draw between contemporary technological development and past regulatory success and failures?
* Are new corporate governance models necessary and/or possible to mitigate harm and protect against misuse of these tools?

# Political Economy
* Emerging AI technologies will place immense power in the hands of executives, engineers, and early adopters with greater familiarity with the technology. How should we manage this growing power difference?
* How might LLMs challenge traditional economic institutions including, but not limited to, copyright and IP?
* Will new technological developments decrease the labor share of capital as more work is done by computers? Will this impact be felt hardest by knowledge and creative economy workers? What regulatory mechanisms for economic and social well-being might confront this challenge?
* Will decentralized financial technology change the balance of powers in the global economy? Increase financial inclusion? divide wealth and political power in a different manner?

# Understanding LLMs
* How does the pace and experimental nature of AI development push on traditional frameworks for ethical and normative thinking? How might pragmatic methods in ethical thinking both encourage and place healthy limits on technological experimentation?
* Who should humanistic and ethical research on AI serve? Who are the relevant stakeholders in debates about technology?
* How have popular media (and the long history of robots in science fiction) constructed our imaginary of "artificial intelligence?"
* How can researchers across disciplines work to translate scientific and technological progress into ordinary language accessible for public participation? How might such a glossary provide the requisite knowledge and language for public deliberation of technological innovation?
* In the age of Deep Fakes, non-binary truths and micro-targeted persuasion, how can we develop technological structures to establish provenance?
* What are helpful and unhelpful analogies for how this type of "intelligence" operates? What are the major failure modes of these analogies?

# Intelligence, Superintelligence, and Large-Scale Risks
* Intelligence and Superintelligence: Is it plausible? How should we describe it? How/how should we prepare for it?
* Many of our sociopolitical systems rely on the human interpretation of domain-specific language. How will LLMs enable interoperability of previously separate sociopolitical systems, and what consequences might this interoperability present?
