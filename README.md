# Overview
The GETTING-Plurality research network at the Harvard Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics is a hub at Harvard University which brings together various researchers focused on how to shape, guide, govern, and deploy technological development in support of democracy, collective intelligence, and other public goods. More information on the research network can be found here: https://gettingplurality.org/ 

The research network has collectively pooled current open research questions in response to the developments in artificial intelligence that will inform our research priorities over the coming months. Our aim is to (1) share the current questions our research network members see as a priority (2) have the broader community contribute to this open repository of research questions and (3) solicit relevant collaboration from other individuals or organizations working in similar research areas.

If you have questions or relevant research, please feel free to reach out to us at contact@gettingplurality.org 

# Contribute
We strongly encourage contributions from the public as we continue to build out a robust repository of open research questions posed by artificial intelligence to our society at large. Contributions can be made with the standard git issue-fork-pull request-merge process. These requests will be reviewed by the GETTING-Plurality core team.
